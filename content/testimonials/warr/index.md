I had the pleasure of supervising Mange Xu during their Master's program at the University of Edinburgh. Mange's work in optimizing computational pipelines and accurately identifying virus quasispecies from Nanopore long-read sequencing data was outstanding. Their rigorous quality control measures and advanced visualizations facilitated the effective interpretation of complex data. Mange's dedication to research and their ability to adapt to new technologies set a high standard for their peers.

This study evaluates the PRRSV quasispecies isolation pipeline Untangle using simulated data to identify and isolate viral quasispecies. Key aspects include the accuracy of simulated PRRSV sequences, effectiveness of variant calling, and impact of different polymerases. Simulation shows Untangle can identify and isolate quasispecies for at least 3% of the population, but real data pose challenges due to sequencing errors and coverage needs. Future work aims to improve real data analysis with high-depth nanopore sequencing and optimize the pipeline for better quasispecies identification.
